# Album-review


The premise of this app is that users can sign up, and once signed in they view a list of allbums that other users have uploaded,
they can also add their own album when they press the add buttons tab on the navbar, this will take them to a screen where they enter a form of their preferred choice of album.


## Future features

- I'm enventuallly going to add an upload link so the user can upload an image of their chosen album.
- Im also going to add a ratings systems where other users can rate another users album, and create a system where the albums with the highest amount of rating will be shown at the top.
- I'm also going to include an spotify api that will give users a preview of the top songs from that album.
